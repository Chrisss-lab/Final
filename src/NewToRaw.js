        Why Raw Dog Food Beats Kibble Every Time
      </h1>

      <p>
        Kibble is convenient, but it’s highly processed, full of fillers, starches,
        artificial ingredients, and synthetic vitamins. Raw dog food is fresh, natural,
        and biologically appropriate. Dogs thrive on raw because it mimics what their
        ancestors were naturally selected to eat — meat, organs, bones, and nutrient-rich
        vegetables.
      </p>

      <ul style={listStyle}>
        <li><strong>Better Digestion:</strong> Easier on your dog’s stomach than ultra-processed kibble.</li>
        <li><strong>Shiny Coat & Healthy Skin:</strong> Natural fats and nutrients improve appearance and health.</li>
        <li><strong>Higher Energy & Vitality:</strong> Dogs feel active and playful.</li>
        <li><strong>Stronger Immune System:</strong> Nutrient-dense meals support overall health.</li>
        <li><strong>Dental Health:</strong> Chewing raw meaty bones helps clean teeth naturally.</li>
      </ul>

      <div style={sectionStyle}>
        <h2 style={headerStyle}>New to Raw Feeding?</h2>
        <p>
          Switching to a raw diet doesn’t have to be intimidating. Raw feeding focuses
          on fresh, whole ingredients, and your dog’s body is built to handle it safely.
          With a gradual approach, your dog will enjoy the transition naturally.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div style={sectionStyle}>
        <h2 style={headerStyle}>Transitioning from Kibble</h2>
        <p>
          Start slow: mix a small portion of raw food with your dog’s current kibble.
          Gradually increase the raw amount over 7–10 days. Watch for stool changes,
          appetite, and energy levels.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div style={sectionDivider}></div>

      <div style={sectionStyle}>
        <h2 style={headerStyle}>Whole Foods vs Synthetic Vitamins</h2>
        <p>
          Many commercial kibble brands rely on artificial vitamins and supplements.
          While these vitamins are added to meet nutritional labels, they are not absorbed
          as efficiently by the body. At Jersey Raw, we provide all essential nutrients
          through whole foods — beef, liver, heart, eggs, and fresh vegetables. Nutrients
          in whole foods are naturally more bioavailable, meaning your dog absorbs and
          uses them better, supporting stronger health and longevity.

        <p>
          Dogs evolved to eat raw, whole foods. Their digestive system is designed to
          handle raw meat, bones, and organs. Raw food is safe, natural, and extremely
          beneficial — far superior to kibble or other processed foods.
